Trick or Treat App

Description:
This is a web application built using React and JSON-Server. The purpose of this application is to allow users to host and find available trick or treating locations for Halloween! Users can sign up with an address and either host or find available nearby locations that are hosting trick or treating. I was inspired to make this while trick or treating with my son on Halloween in 2021.

Installation:
This project can be run locally with NPM using 'npm start' in both the json-server-template folder and the trick-or-treat folder. To have full fuctionality of the application it will require API keys for Google Map API and Position Stack. Both have free tiered memberships (as of January 2023) and will provide you with an API key that you can use. You will need to create a .env file with the following environmental variables:

REACT_APP_GMAP_API_KEY=your assigned API key from Google Map API
REACT_APP_POSSTACK_API_KEY=your assigned API key from Position Stack API
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

With this in place, you should be able to run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' in both the json-server-template folder and the trick-or-treat folders.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
